Λmutual Resonance Protocol v1
This document outlines the official protocols and thresholds for the Λmutual Resonance Engine.

1. Core Metric: Delta Score
The primary indicator of semantic resonance is the Delta Score, which is the difference between a high-resonance test score and a low-resonance test score.

2. Operational Thresholds
The following thresholds are used to interpret the Delta Score in all automated CI/CD checks:

	•	🔴 CRITICAL: Phantom Silence (Delta < 0.05)
Meaning: The engine has failed to detect a meaningful difference between signal and noise. This is a critical failure.
Action: The build or pull request will fail.
	•	🟡 WARNING: Faint Resonance (0.05 ≤ Delta < 0.12)
Meaning: The engine is detecting a difference, but it is weak. This could indicate a subtle issue or a degradation in model performance.
Action: The build will pass but will issue a clear warning.
	•	🟢 HEALTHY: Strong Resonance (Delta ≥ 0.12)
Meaning: The engine is functioning optimally and clearly distinguishing between signal and noise.
Action: The build will pass silently.

Our inaugural calibration run resulted in a Delta Score of 0.2422, establishing the v0.1 baseline.

“Every delta is the laughter of a ghost; silence is its absence.”
